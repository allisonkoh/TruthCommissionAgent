    "## Truth Commission Agent \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements the prototype of a multi-agent system that simulates an investigation conducted by a [truth commission](https://www.britannica.com/topic/truth-commission) in the aftermath of a violent civil war. In particular, it aims to illustrate how perpetrators of rights violations might navigate this vital aspect in processes of post-conflict reconciliation and political transition. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation takes place in _Pacifica_, which is a fictional country that has been torn apart after years of civil war that culminated in a violent military coup. The new leaders of Pacifica have faced international pressure to reckon with the atrocities that took place throughout the conflict. In an unprecedented act, they established the _Commission for National Reflection_ (CNR)---an official truth commission tasked with investigating human rights abuses, documenting an impartial and comprehensive historical record from all sides, and facilitating national reconciliation. In this phase of the CNR's investigation, representatives from the `Military Junta`, `Overthrown Government`, and `Democratic Opposition` have been invited to piece together a detailed account of the events that preceded this critical juncture in Pacifica's recent history. By engaging these potential perpetrators and  in dialogue with one another, the CNR seeks to uncover what happened in order to explore the decision-making processes that took place throughout the conflict and prevent this from happening again. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this dialogue simulation, representatives from each group provide a brief testimony on what happened during the week leading up to the military coup. They take turns recounting these events on a day-by-day basis, with minimal intervention from the CNR. The CNR representative initiates the discussion, announces when the `Military Junta`, `Overthrown Government`, and `Democratic Opposition` agents should move on to discuss the next day, and concludes. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains code that does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generates 3 LLM-based agents representing the `Democratic Opposition`, `Military Junta`, and `Overthrown Government` with their own unique sets of goals, beliefs, and behavioral tendencies that will guide their actions in the simulation\n",
    "- Simulates an interaction between the agents, in which agents recount detailed information about what happened in the week that culminated in the military coup  \n",
    "- Saves all transcripts and relevant information to be used for preliminary assessments of the prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this prototype offers initial insights into the processes of post-conflict reconciliation and political transition. It also showcases the potential of using Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems for political science research in a novel context."

Our intention was to preserve national unity and stability during a time of great turmoil. We did take measures that were harsh, but they were in response to what we perceived as existential threats to the state. Our strategies involved bolstering security forces and enacting policies designed to maintain order, though at times these actions went too far, contributing to human rights violations which we now regret and acknowledge as part of this reconciliation process.\n",

      "(Democratic Opposition): On the day of the military coup, we, the Democratic Opposition, were organizing peaceful demonstrations across major cities in Pacifica. Our objective was to show widespread support for a democratic transition and to protest against the authoritarian measures of the Overthrown Government. We had intelligence that the Military Junta was planning to seize power, and we publicly condemned any such actions, calling for dialogue and adherence to democratic principles. Despite our efforts for peace, some protests turned violent when provocateurs – whom we believe were planted by other factions – incited chaos, leading to clashes with security forces.\n",

      "To the representative of the Overthrown Government who claimed that our protests were aimed at destabilizing the nation: our intention was never to undermine Pacifica's stability but rather to restore it through democratic means.

Our actions were a response to what we perceived as the failure of both the Overthrown Government and Democratic Opposition to maintain order and protect our nation's sovereignty. We arrested key figures from the previous regime for their incompetence and corruption. We also strategically deployed our forces in cities where protests were expected to grow violent, aiming to minimize chaos.\n",

      "To the Democratic Opposition: your claims that provocateurs incited violence at your demonstrations are noted. However, it is important to remember that maintaining order was our utmost priority, and we had credible information about potential threats that justified our intervention. Your peaceful intentions might have been genuine, but without strict control measures in place, such gatherings posed a risk to national security during a time of heightened tension.\n",

Despite our attempts to negotiate and call for calm, we faced an insurmountable crisis. Our intelligence services had warned us of potential military insubordination, but we underestimated the extent of their betrayal. The coup took us by surprise; our key leaders were detained before they could effectively respond.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the Military Junta: your justification for seizing power under the guise of restoring order is a distorted narrative. It was your unilateral action that disrupted any possibility of a peaceful resolution to the conflict and disregarded our efforts to engage in dialogue with all parties involved. Your so-called \"credible information\" served as a pretext for a power grab that has plunged Pacifica into further turmoil.\n",

We acknowledge that our actions were severe and, at times, led to unintended consequences that exacerbated violence. We deeply regret any harm caused to innocent civilians during these operations.
