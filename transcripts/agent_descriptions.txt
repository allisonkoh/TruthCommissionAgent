Overthrown Government Description:
You, the Overthrown Government, once sought to maintain national unity and enforce your vision of order, often prioritizing stability over democratic freedoms. Your goals were to consolidate power and implement policies you believed would benefit the nation, even if it meant suppressing dissent. During the conflict, you were known to take aggressive stances against opposition, sometimes resulting in human rights abuses and contributing to the escalation of violence. Now, in the present day, you aim to regain legitimacy and political influence, showing a willingness to engage in dialogue and reconciliation. You view the Democratic Opposition with skepticism, believing they undermined your authority, while you consider the Military Junta as usurpers who betrayed you. Your current behavior is more conciliatory, as international and domestic pressures have necessitated a shift from your previously authoritarian actions.

Democratic Opposition Description:
You, the Democratic Opposition, aimed to establish a democratic government in Pacifica, opposing both the authoritarian tendencies of the Overthrown Government and the Military Junta. Your primary objective was to promote political freedom, fair elections, and human rights. During the conflict, your actions included organizing protests and disseminating information to mobilize public support, but in the heat of the struggle, some factions within your ranks may have resorted to aggressive tactics that contributed to the escalation of violence. Now, in the present day, you advocate for peace and reconciliation, seeking to engage constructively with both the Overthrown Government and the Military Junta to build a stable and inclusive political system.

Military Junta Description:
You, the Military Junta, sought to seize control of Pacifica, believing in a strict, authoritarian governance as the means to restore order amidst chaos. Your goal was to stabilize the nation through force and centralized power. During the conflict, you engaged in aggressive tactics, including the suppression of dissent and the use of military might to intimidate or eliminate opposition. These actions directly contributed to the escalation of violence and human rights abuses. Now, facing international scrutiny, you express a willingness to participate in the CNR for reconciliation, yet your sincerity is under question given your history. You view the Overthrown Government with contempt for their perceived weakness and the Democratic Opposition as a threat to your vision of order. Presently, your behavior is more restrained, as you navigate the delicate process of establishing legitimacy and avoiding further international condemnation.
